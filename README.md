# Basketball
## For this assignment I created 5 directories, 5 subdirectories, and 5 files for each of the subdirectories.
I chose to work with 5 of my favorite NBA basketball teams; Detroit Pistons, Boston Celtics, Golden State Warriors, Chicago Bulls, Phoenix Suns. In each team I included my top 5 favorite players on that team. 
For each of the players, I included their height, weight, the country the play in, where they played basketball before they entered the NBA, age, birthday, draft pick and how many years they have been playing in the league for.
